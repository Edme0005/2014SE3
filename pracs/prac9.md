Test Cases for Existing Open-Source Project
===========================================

This is the competency gate for obtaining Distinction in this topic.

To pass this gate you will need to write one, or ideally several
test cases for some existing software.  The tests must be actionable,
and of a quality that would be acceptable for inclusion in open-source
software.  The tests must be appropriately packaged and documented to allow
submission to the open-source software under consideration, and then actually
submitted.  

Your tests do not however have to be accepted, but we do encourage you to follow
through with the submission process as far as the project will allow.  The experience
and acknowledgement of contributing to a real software project will be invaluable to
you in many ways.

To obtain the checkpoint you must submit an issue that refers to sufficient evidence of the work you have done, and where it has been submitted.
