Welcome to Software Engineering 3: Testing & Quality
====================================================

The first prac is an introduction to git as a source control system.

Source control is a really important part of creating quality software, because it allows you to know who changed what and when, and by combining this with tests, it allows you to quickly identify which specific change(s) cause a test to fail.

Today you will:
  * Configure git in your CSEM computer account.
  * Create a github account.
  * Create a local git repository, and make multiple commits to it.
  * Create a git repository on github.
  * Push commits from a local repository to a remote repository hosted on github.
  * Pull commits from a remote repository to a local git repository.
  * Send a pull request to the owner of a repository, asking them to accept changes that you are proposing.
  * Use git to request that your checkpoint be marked off.

This is a really important prac, because you will continue to use git to request that your checkpoints be marked off, and as you should know by now, they will form the entire (or in the case of GE students, the overwhelming majority) of your final grade.

If you spot any errors or omissions in this material, it is all stored in a git repository, so you can make the changes in a local copy of the repository, and send me a pull request asking me to accept the changes.
