Whitebox Testing
================

Whitebox text one of the following:
  * Your 2048 game
  * A classmate's 2048 game (fork their git repository and work on that).
  * Some open-source software.

Submit an issue to the 2014S3 repository with a URL to the commit log for the
repository where you have written the white-box tests.  

You will need to write 10 tests to obtain the checkpoint.

Whitebox tests concentrate on exercising as many code paths and lines of the
source code as possible.  This is in contrast to the Unit Tests you wrote as
part of our Test Driven Design work earlier in the course. 

Those tests were
blackbox tests, i.e., written without reference to the source code (in that
case the source code didn't even exist), and as such were Black Box tests.

Another difference is that Black Box tests are focused on the functionality
and specification, rather than verifying correct behaviour of each line of
code in the solution.

In other words, Black Box tests are functional, while White Box tests are
structural.
